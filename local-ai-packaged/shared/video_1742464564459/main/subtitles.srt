1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,737
Quantum computers could crack today's toughest codes in seconds.

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,846
Your bank password?

3
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:05,781
Gone in a blink!

4
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:09,751
They don’t think in 1s and 0s; they think in quantum superpositions.

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:12,496
Translation: millions of possibilities at once.

6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:17,693
From drug discovery to climate models, these powerhouses could reshape entire industries.

7
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:22,481
Imagine solving problems in minutes that would take classical computers centuries.

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,810
But here's the kicker — we’re still in the early innings.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,919
The tech is wild...

10
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:27,970
but not yet tamed.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,956
So, are we unlocking the future...

12
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:31,416
or opening Pandora’s box?
