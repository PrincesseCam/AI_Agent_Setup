00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.737
Quantum computers could crack today's toughest codes in seconds.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:04.846
Your bank password?

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:05.781
Gone in a blink!

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:09.751
They don’t think in 1s and 0s; they think in quantum superpositions.

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.496
Translation: millions of possibilities at once.

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:17.693
From drug discovery to climate models, these powerhouses could reshape entire industries.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:22.481
Imagine solving problems in minutes that would take classical computers centuries.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.810
But here's the kicker — we’re still in the early innings.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.919
The tech is wild...

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:27.970
but not yet tamed.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.956
So, are we unlocking the future...

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:31.416
or opening Pandora’s box?
